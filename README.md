## 📁 Projects Overview

| Project | Title | Description |
|:-------:|:------|:------------|
| 1 | Project A: Comparing fMRI Functional Data: NORDIC vs. Non-NORDIC | Evaluates the impact of NORDIC denoising on functional MRI quality, signal stability, and downstream analyses. |
| 2 | Project B: Comparing Hippocampals Segmentation Software in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Normal Controls | Compares segmentation perfomance using Freesurfer and ASHS software of hippocampus segmentation. |
| 2 | Project C: Freesurfer Hippocampal Segmentation Methods | Compares segmentation performance using different input modalities: T1-only, T2-only, T2 high-resolution (T2H), T1+T2, and T1+T2H. |
| 3 | Project D: TBD | Placeholder for upcoming research project — topic and direction still in development. |

Each project contains:

* Source code and scripts.
* Dataset references or data folder.
* Result visualizations.
* A dedicated README.md for deeper details.
